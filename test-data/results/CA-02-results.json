      "userMessage": "Can you tell me about Mercury?",
      "botResponse": "Ah, Mercury, the sun-baked, speedy little planet! It's a fascinating world, and I'd be happy to tell you more. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Closest to the Sun:** Mercury is the innermost planet in our solar system, which means it gets *a lot* of sunlight. This leads to some pretty wild temperature swings.\n*   **Extreme Temperatures:** During the day, the side of Mercury facing the Sun can reach a blistering 800째F (430째C). But because it has almost no atmosphere to trap heat, the nighttime temperatures plummet to a frigid -290째F (-180째C). That's quite the difference!\n*   **Speedy Orbit:** Mercury has the shortest orbital period of any planet, zipping around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. Talk about a quick year!\n*   **Heavily Cratered Surface:** Like our Moon, Mercury's surface is covered in craters, a testament to its long history of being bombarded by asteroids and comets.\n*   **Surprisingly Dense:** Despite being small, Mercury is incredibly dense, which suggests it has a large, iron core.\n\nWould you like to dive deeper into any of these aspects, or is there anything else you're curious about regarding Mercury? I'm ready to share more!\n",

      "botResponse": "Yes, I understand now! You mean Earth. My apologies for the misunderstanding. What about Earth are you curious about? I can tell you about its:\n\n*   **Physical characteristics:** Size, mass, density, composition, etc.\n*   **Atmosphere and climate:** Weather patterns, climate zones, atmospheric layers, etc.\n*   **Geology:** Tectonic plates, rock formations, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc.\n*   **History:** Formation, evolution of life, major geological events, etc.\n*   **Environment:** Ecosystems, biodiversity, environmental issues, etc.\n\nJust let me know what specifically you'd like to discuss about Earth!\n",

For example, are you asking about the composition of the Earth, the sun, a specific chemical compound, or something else?
